By using biologically active substances like platelet-rich plasma (PRP), growth factor concentrate (GFC), bone marrow concentrate, and stem cells, these advanced treatments accelerate tissue repair, reduce inflammation, and promote long-term recovery. Ideal for athletes and active individuals, they offer faster healing, less downtime, and a powerful, science-backed alternative to traditional orthopedic procedures.\",\n      \"image\": \"/programmes3.png\"\n    }\n  ]"
